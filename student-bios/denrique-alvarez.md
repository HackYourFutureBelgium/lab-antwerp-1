# Hello everyone! :v:

## Daniel

Hello, everyone! I am Daniel and I live in Medell√≠n, Colombia. I am 32 years old and I am a professional in linguistics and literature graduated from the University of Antioquia. That's in Colombia, by the way. I have taught Spanish as a second language for more than six years to students from all over the world.

I moved to Belgium with my wife only 3 months ago and I am looking to start a completely new career in IT, which has been one of my perosonal interests for some time. I speak Spanish, English en een beetje Nederlands.

Ik hou van muziek :musical_note: :musical_keyboard:, boeken :books: en sporten :basketball: :bicyclist: .
